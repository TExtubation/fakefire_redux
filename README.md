## FakeFire_Redux ##

v0.99

A decoration only mod filled with propa... fire and fire related accessories.

A fairly extensive rewrite (though admittedly, probably not a good one) of the fake_fire mod(s) found around the minetest forums, as well as other various mods. It started out as a way to make chimneys produce smoke when you started the server, so you didn't have to go around hitting them to make them smoke, and well, it grew into this.

This mod adds 46 nodes in total. 10 smoking and smokeless plantlike fire nodes with flames of five different colors. 20 smoking and smokeless "Fancy" mesh fire nodes with regular wood logs or burnt animated logs with flames in five different colors. 14 smoking and smokeless chimneys of various brick and stone configurations. 1 glowing ember node, and 1 place-able smoke node.

Note - Only 13 nodes show in the creative mode inventory (this is intentional, read further for more info).

### Usage ###
Smoking fire and mesh fire nodes will immediately begin smoking on placement, or on restart of server. Right clicking on any of the fire nodes (smoking or smokeless) will cycle through its different flame and or log colors. All flame and log color changes will remain even after a reboot.

Upon placement of a chimney it will begin smoking. Right clicking a chimney will stop its smoke. Right clicking again, will start it back up. All smoke changes will remain even after a reboot.

The smoke node is a node that is place-able and destroy-able, which produces a column of smoke just like the fire and chimney nodes. However this is an invisible node that you can even walk through, and can be placed anywhere (great for anything meant to produce smoke).

### Additional Info ###
As these are solely meant for decoration and creative mode, no crafting recipes are provided, nor do any of the nodes drop items.

The colored fire animations are hue shifted copies of the original fake_fire animation. And the new custom smoke particle... is... well, just because.

### Depends ###
default? As it only relies on the default texture names used for the chimneys.

Note - This mod was tested on minetest 5.0.1, 5.2, 5.3 and works without errors on MineClone2, Lord-of-the-Test, Regnum, Farlands, and Minetest_Game, as they all use the default stone and brick texture names.

##### ToDo
It does what I want it to do. Feel free to hack it.
